Combining art and design with code...
* Projecting things on buildings!
* Pixel phones!

People tend towards specialising in either Coding or Design. The graph dips.
Combining a coder into a designer - a Creative Coder!
**Live coding on a commodore 64 emulator!!** 1 line of code to draw hearts...
**Why combine coder and designer?**
For ideas - A designer coming up with ideas and not knowing how to build it.

### Hybridify yourself!

#### Designers

Learn to code... Like, right now!
Seb showing everyone how to code with canvas and JS, making a square animate and now onto particles...
**Discovery** By doing this you can discover more for yourself.

####Â Coders

Play with visual stuff!
Enjoy and understand the creative process
Asteroids - does exactly what it's meant to do... but it's rubbish, "it feels like shit"
Play with things until they feel better, experiment, don't just do what it's meant to do!
Experimenting can lead to good stuff...

### Will people pay for this?

Probably not, but they might in the future, do this for fun and hopefully something will come of it.
Do you always want to be making "other peoples stupid ideas"? (_probably not_)

### Play. Create. Share.

Work on small, fun projects if you can, basically finish the things you start!
